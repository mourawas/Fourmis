# üêú Anthill Simulation

This project is a C++ simulation of ant behavior in an anthill, featuring a custom-built graphical user interface (GUI). The simulation models ant activities like foraging and communication, allowing real-time observation and interaction. The project is fully customizable, with adjustable parameters for ant population and environment settings. To get started, simply clone the repository, compile the code, and run the executable.
